android tracking app

## no longer on Google Play

Google Play removed this app after a year of it being in the store. Their reasoning was it
allowed serendipitous tracking but wouldn't say what I needed to change to allow for it 
to remain in the store. So I just let them remove it.

There are other apps with almost identical feature sets including Google's own Trusted
Contacts app. Feel free to use those.

Lesson learned: if you create software for someone's walled garden be prepared for them to
remove it and not help you get it back up.
